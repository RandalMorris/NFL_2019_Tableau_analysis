# NFL 2019 Tableau Analysis
Tableau dashboard created to showcase a combination of traditional and advanced statistics for Offensive NFL players during the 2019 regular season.
Due to the upswing in passing attempts in the NFL over the last decade, the game favors offensive production more than ever. That has allowed receptions for all pass-catchers to exponentially increase. The following dashboard created will visualize the statistics for the quarterbacks who attempted at least double-digit passes, the majority of players who received passing targets during the season, and the majority of players who had rushing attempts during the season.

Main statistical categories: Passing, Rushing, Receiving
